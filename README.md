    <h2>Current State of Affairs</h2>
    <p>At this stage, we are actively gathering Python, PS1, and BAT scripts that will enable us to implement all the
        exciting features described earlier. However, it's important to note that the project's components, namely the
        "brain," "eyes," "hands," and "ears," are not yet fully connected.</p>
    <p>We are working tirelessly to bring these components together and create a cohesive and seamless experience with
        <strong>Cartuli</strong>. Our goal is to ensure that each part of <strong>Cartuli</strong> works in perfect harmony, allowing you to unleash
        the full potential of this AI Assistant.</p>
    <p>In addition to the software development, we are also dedicated to creating a delightful Stream Deck profile that
        seamlessly integrates with the Elgato Stream Deck and its variants, including the Stream Deck + and Stream Deck
        XL. This will enable you to have a personalized and intuitive interface for interacting with <strong>Cartuli</strong> and
        performing tasks effortlessly.</p>
    <p>As we continue to make progress, we will keep the community updated on the development process and share exciting
        updates along the way. Together, we will bring <strong>Cartuli</strong> to life and revolutionize the way you interact with AI
        Assistants.</p>
