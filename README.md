    <h2>Dissection</h2>
    <p>In the development of <strong>Cartuli</strong>, we have carefully chosen the tools and libraries that power its
        functionality. Let's take a closer look at the architectural components:</p>

<h3>üëÇEars: Python SpeechRecognition</h3>
<p>For speech recognition capabilities, we rely on the powerful Python library called SpeechRecognition. It's a
    versatile and reliable tool that allows <strong>Cartuli</strong> to listen and understand your voice commands
    surprisingly well. With SpeechRecognition, <strong>Cartuli</strong> can accurately capture your instructions and
    initiate the corresponding actions.</p>

<h3>üß†Brain: Spacy for Text Classification</h3>
<p>Spacy is our go-to library for text recognition and understanding. With its advanced natural language processing
    capabilities, <strong>Cartuli</strong>'s brain can analyze and comprehend your commands and queries. Spacy
    enables <strong>Cartuli</strong> to extract meaningful information from the text, empowering it to perform the
    right actions based on your input.</p>

<h3>üëÑMouth: Plyer for Windows Notifications</h3>
<p>To provide you with timely feedback and updates, <strong>Cartuli</strong> utilizes the Plyer library for
    displaying Windows notifications. Plyer allows <strong>Cartuli</strong> to deliver important information,
    reminders, and notifications right on your desktop. Whether it's completion notifications, task updates, or
    simply a friendly message, <strong>Cartuli</strong>'s mouth ensures that you stay informed and connected.</p>

<h3>üëåHands: Pygetwindow for Windows Control</h3>
<p>For seamless control over Windows applications, we rely on the Pygetwindow library. Pygetwindow enables <strong>Cartuli</strong>
    to interact with and manipulate windows, allowing it to open programs, switch between applications, and perform
    various window-related tasks. With Pygetwindow, <strong>Cartuli</strong> takes full command of your Windows 11
    environment, making your development experience even smoother.</p>

<p>By leveraging the capabilities of these powerful libraries, <strong>Cartuli</strong> achieves a robust and
    efficient architecture that enables seamless interaction, understanding, and communication. Together, they form
    the foundation of <strong>Cartuli</strong>'s intelligence and assistive capabilities, making it a reliable and
    enjoyable AI Assistant for your Windows 11 environment.</p>

<h2>Setting up the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable</h2>

<p>To use this project, you'll need to set up an environment variable called <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>. This is a secret API key provided by OpenAI that's required to access their APIs.</p>

<p>Here's how you can obtain your <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit the <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction">OpenAI API website</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Sign up for OpenAI" button and follow the instructions to create an account.</li>
  <li>Once you have created an account, log in to the OpenAI API website.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the "API keys" section of your account dashboard.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Generate new key" button to create a new API key.</li>
  <li>Copy the generated API key.</li>
  <li>Set the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable in your local environment by running the following command in your terminal (replacing <code>&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;</code> with your actual API key):</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>export OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can also set the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable in a configuration file such as <code>.env</code>, which can be loaded by your project's code.</p>

<p>Once you have set up the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable, you should be able to use the OpenAI APIs in your project.</p>
