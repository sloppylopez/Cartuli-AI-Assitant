    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>In the development of <strong>Cartuli</strong>, we have carefully chosen the tools and libraries that power its
        functionality. Let's take a closer look at the architectural components:</p>

<h3>üëÇEars: Python SpeechRecognition</h3>
<p>For speech recognition capabilities, we rely on the powerful Python library called SpeechRecognition. It's a
    versatile and reliable tool that allows <strong>Cartuli</strong> to listen and understand your voice commands
    surprisingly well. With SpeechRecognition, <strong>Cartuli</strong> can accurately capture your instructions and
    initiate the corresponding actions.</p>

<h3>üß†Brain: Spacy for Text Classification</h3>
<p>Spacy is our go-to library for text recognition and understanding. With its advanced natural language processing
    capabilities, <strong>Cartuli</strong>'s brain can analyze and comprehend your commands and queries. Spacy
    enables <strong>Cartuli</strong> to extract meaningful information from the text, empowering it to perform the
    right actions based on your input.</p>

<h3>üëÑMouth: Plyer for Windows Notifications</h3>
<p>To provide you with timely feedback and updates, <strong>Cartuli</strong> utilizes the Plyer library for
    displaying Windows notifications. Plyer allows <strong>Cartuli</strong> to deliver important information,
    reminders, and notifications right on your desktop. Whether it's completion notifications, task updates, or
    simply a friendly message, <strong>Cartuli</strong>'s mouth ensures that you stay informed and connected.</p>

<h3>üëåHands: Pygetwindow for Windows Control</h3>
<p>For seamless control over Windows applications, we rely on the Pygetwindow library. Pygetwindow enables <strong>Cartuli</strong>
    to interact with and manipulate windows, allowing it to open programs, switch between applications, and perform
    various window-related tasks. With Pygetwindow, <strong>Cartuli</strong> takes full command of your Windows 11
    environment, making your development experience even smoother.</p>

<p>By leveraging the capabilities of these powerful libraries, <strong>Cartuli</strong> achieves a robust and
    efficient architecture that enables seamless interaction, understanding, and communication. Together, they form
    the foundation of <strong>Cartuli</strong>'s intelligence and assistive capabilities, making it a reliable and
    enjoyable AI Assistant for your Windows 11 environment.</p>

    <h2>Current State of Affairs</h2>
    <p>At this stage, we are actively gathering Python, PS1, and BAT scripts that will enable us to implement all the
        exciting features described earlier. However, it's important to note that the project's components, namely the
        "brain," "eyes," "hands," and "ears," are not yet fully connected.</p>
    <p>We are working tirelessly to bring these components together and create a cohesive and seamless experience with
        <strong>Cartuli</strong>. Our goal is to ensure that each part of <strong>Cartuli</strong> works in perfect
        harmony, allowing you to unleash

    <p>In addition to the software development, we are also dedicated to creating a delightful Stream Deck profile that
        seamlessly integrates with the Elgato Stream Deck and its variants, including the Stream Deck + and Stream Deck
        XL. This will enable you to have a personalized and intuitive interface for interacting with
        <strong>Cartuli</strong> and
        performing tasks effortlessly.</p>
    <p>As we continue to make progress, we will keep the community updated on the development process and share exciting
        updates along the way. Together, we will bring <strong>Cartuli</strong> to life and revolutionize the way you
        interact with AI
        Assistants.</p>
